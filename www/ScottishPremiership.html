The Scottish Premiership, known as the cinch Premiership for sponsorship reasons, is the top division of the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL), the league competition for men's professional football clubs in Scotland. The Scottish Premiership was established in July 2013, after the SPFL was formed by a merger of the Scottish Premier League and Scottish Football League. There are 12 teams in this division, with each team playing 38 matches per season. Sixteen clubs have played in the Scottish Premiership since its creation in the 2013–14 season. Rangers are the current league champions, having won the 2020–21 Scottish Premiership.  
 UEFA grants European places to the Scottish Football Association, determined by Scotland's position in the UEFA country coefficient rankings. The Scottish Football Association in turn allocates a number of these European places to final Scottish Premiership positions. At the end of the 2020–21 season, Scotland was ranked 11th in Europe – granting them two teams in the UEFA Champions League, one team in the UEFA Europa League, and two teams in the UEFA Europa Conference League.
For the 2020–21 season, the top placed team in the Scottish Premiership gained qualification to the Champions League third qualifying round, whilst the second placed team entered at the second qualifying round stage. The third and fourth placed teams entered the inaugural Europa Conference League at the qualifying round stage.
Scotland's place in the Europa League third qualifying round is awarded to the winners of the Scottish Cup. Should the winners of that competition have already qualified for European competition, then the fifth placed team also enters the Europa Conference League second qualifying round, while third placed team (unless they are cup winners themselves) are promoted from Europa Conference League to the Europa League third qualifying round.
Due to the Europa League group stage spot reserved for the Europa Conference League title holder being vacant in 2021–22, it was expected that the 2020–21 Scottish Cup winner (St Johnstone) would enter the Europa League play-off round instead, thus guaranteeing at least a group stage berth in the Conference League even if that play-off tie was lost.A change in the UEFA access list however meant that this will not happen unless there is a further change in the access list of the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League, with Scotland being the first nation to benefit first from any additional direct entries to the play-off round.
